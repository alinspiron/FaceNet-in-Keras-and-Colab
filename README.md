# FaceNet-in-Keras-and-Colab

This project is developed using blog by Jason Brownlee at Machine Learning Mastery. It is further modified in Google Colab. In this project, Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network architecture provided by Iv√°n de Paz Centeno, is used for facial detections and for facial recognition, pre-trained Keras FaceNet model provided by Hiroki Taniai, is utilized. Dataset used for this purpose is 5 Celebrity Faces Dataset, Kaggle alongwith my pictures. Requirements:

    1. FaceNet Model: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pwQ3H4aJ8a6yyJHZkTwtjcL4wYWQb7bn)
    2. 5-Celebrity Dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset)
    3. Verdana.ttf Text FONT: (https://www.fontpalace.com/font-download/Verdana/)

Download and put them in project directory/google drive and adjust directories in project accordingly
