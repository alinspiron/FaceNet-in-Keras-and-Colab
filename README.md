# FaceNet-in-Keras-and-Colab

This project is developed using blog by Jason Brownlee at Machine Learning Mastery. It is further modified in Google Colab. In this project, Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network architecture provided by Iv√°n de Paz Centeno, is used for facial detections and for facial recognition, pre-trained Keras FaceNet model provided by Hiroki Taniai, is utilized. Dataset used for this purpose is 5 Celebrity Faces Dataset, Kaggle alongwith my pictures. Requirements:

    FaceNet Model
    5-Celebrity Dataset
    Verdana.ttf

Download and put them in current directory/google drive and adjust directories in project accordingly
